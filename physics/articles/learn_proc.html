<div class="article_title">Structure of the learning process in a FPU physics faculty</div>

<p>A main question is also what the didactical and pedagogical framework of the learning environment of a FPU is supposed to be. A detailed analysis of the possible scenarios has been developed in the book “Free Progress Education”. Since this is still a university which is in its first stages of development, we will keep the structure simple, while keeping in mind that things should be dynamic and flexible, which means that in the future the approach could be modified and re-arranged according to the experience and the results. A possible outline could be as follows.</p>

<p>A group of students (say min. 5, max 10) wants to learn the basic foundations of modern theoretical physics. For this a didactical scheme, according to a flipped teaching format and inquiry based learning, has been developed as follows.
</p>

<p>Phase 1: Students first study on a textbook (TB) by themselves (say classical mechanics). This TB is a first choice from a list of other alternatives everyone can use also. But the first choice TB is considered one of the best and is therefore taken as the primary source that is followed by the study group.
 </p> 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phase 1b: During the TB study phase first issues and questions may arise that could be preliminarily discussed on a forum section online. Here students can interact by discuss things in a written format online as a first informative session in preparation to further elaboration in phase 2.
</p>

<p>Phase 2: When the above phase has been worked through by the participants (say a chapter that introduced Euler-Lagrange equations), they meet ideally in a brick and mortar structure and/or (as it is most probable, especially in the first phases of existence of the FPU) online on a study community (e.g. using the Moodle platform) via Skype or G+ Hangouts or other video conferencing systems. Here they meet with one advisor or ‘learning mentor’ (a physicists or former student who became expert in the subject) who has no political authority, but functions as a ‘helper’. This mentor is already experienced with the subject and will help students to clarify whatever they did not understand in the reading of phase 1 and eventually adds exercise and/or proposes discussions with or among students, but most of all encourages them to research on the base of an inquiry based learning.
</p>

<p>Phase 3: After things have been clarified in the mentor-centred setting the students can turn to a consolidating phase. This can be done alone or better in groups (of two or more) to help each other’s by exercising, discussing and repeating the content.
</p>

<p>Phase 4: The social phase and the opportunity for students to know each other’s better and eventually initiate project oriented collaborations is also an important part of the learning process in a FPU. To encourage this, seminars or events are organized, which can, but must not necessarily be related to the ongoing subject. Say for instance that of attending a seminar on celestial mechanics or a question and answer session with someone expert in a field online, make an interview with a Nobel laureate, the online attendance with discussion of the launch of a SpaceX rocket, etc. These activities are ideally initiated and organised by students themselves.
</p>


<p>Phase 5: Repeats phase 1-4 until the TB has been studied through or at least the part of interest.</p>

<p>Phase 6: Once a specific amount of knowledge has been acquired the student has the possibility to show how he/she learned the topic. Instead of tests and grades every student is therefore expected to do a research and inquiry or create a document with the notions learned and which demonstrates how the contents have been learned and applied. This should lead to a first part of a competence portfolio.
</p>

<p>Phase 7: The next subject and TB is learned repeating the loop from 1-6.</p>

<p>Phase 8: After all the subjects one wanted to learn have been learned (not all are necessary, it depends from what one wants to learn), a sort of final thesis or research or special and individual creation can be delivered. This adds to the final part of the competence portfolio and would be eventually the most important part of it. The student can rely on an unknown mentor for the final ‘MD thesis’, but the mentor is not necessary and at any rate must not be disclosed (acknowledgments must be authorised).
</p>
 

<p>Once this is done, the student has gone through all the subjects to be learned without exams or painstaking selections, but instead of grades and a certificate has build his/her personalized portfolio which may already contain research, experiments, eventually publications, a book, the creation of teaching videos, etc., and that can be presented to a potential employer. Something a graduate student from a conventional university can only dream of!
</p>

<p>Schematically the idea can be summarized in the following graph.</p>
